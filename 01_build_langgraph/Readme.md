## üìÑ Step 1: Create `.env` File

Make a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```env
WX_MODEL_ID=mistralai/mistral-large
WX_URL=https://eu-de.ml.cloud.ibm.com
WX_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
WX_API_KEY=<your_wx_api>
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://news-mcp.1x378ktkz0ug.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
```

## Step 2: Build the Docker Image
```
docker build -t my-fastapi-agent .   
```

## Step 3: Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-fastapi-agent
```


## Step 4: [Optional]

go to: 
```
